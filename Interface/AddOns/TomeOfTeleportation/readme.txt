Tome of Teleportation
---------------------

Tome of Teleportation organises all of your teleporting spells and items into
a single window.  If the item needs to be equipped then it will automatically
be unequipped after you have teleported. The Tome also lets you create macros
to use the spells.  Just type /tele to open the Tome.

The buttons in the Tome of Teleportation will each be one of three colours:
* Green: You can cast this spell now.
* Yellow: This spell is on cooldown. The cooldown remaining is displayed on 
  the button.
* Red: This item is cast using an item that must be equipped. Click on the 
  button once to equip it.  If this doesn't start a cooldown, then click again
  to teleport.  Once the summon is successful or you close the Tome the item
  will be unequipped.
  
You can create a macro for a teleportation item by Ctrl + clicking the button.
The macro will be placed on your cursor and it can be dragged onto an action 
bar. This macro acts like the buttons in the Tome, with the first click 
equipping the item and the second click using it.

Known issues
------------

It is not possible to open or close Tome of Teleportation while in combat due 
to restrictions in the way addons work.
