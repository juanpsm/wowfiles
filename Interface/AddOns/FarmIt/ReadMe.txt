FarmIt is a free-floating interface addon. It can be positioned anywhere on the screen.
This mod was created to allow a player to track how many they have of ANY ITEM. 
This is especially helpful when farming for items that cannot be placed on the in-game skill bar. 
For example: I use this mod when I am farming elementals, so I know how many motes I have without needing to dig through my bags and count every time I loot one.

<b>To open the Options Panel, right click on the bar anchor (where it says "FarmIt").</b>
For a list of available slash commands, type: /farmit

<b>About FarmIt</b>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FarmIt has been written to be as light and fast as possible. 
This addon uses an optimized item count method via effective use of the World of Warcraft API. 
This allows for many powerful and convenient features, while remaining a fast and efficient addon. 

FarmIt is able to include your bank inventory <i>without needing to be at the bank!</i> 
Item search also includes the keyring. (Great for items like Etherium Prison Keys, Relic Coffer Keys, etc.)

The options panel allows you to control and customize many things about FarmIt. 
Right-click the base of the item bar to bring up the options panel. 
Hovering with the mouse over the controls on the options panel should pop-up a brief explanantion of what that setting does.

Bar orientation can be switched between vertical and horizontal modes. 
When in horizontal mode, the item text labels are automatically hidden. 
Item text is automatically re-enabled when you switch back to vertical mode. 
The direction the slots "grow out" horizontally can be changed via the options panel.

FarmIt offers "set it and forget it" farming objectives. 
Current item count is displayed in the top-left corner of each slot, and your objective in the bottom-right corner. 
Optionally, FarmIt will notify you each time you loot a tracked item you are farming for.
When you reach your farming objective for a given slot, the goal number will turn green and you will receive an on-screen notification similar to the in-game quest objective messages. (This can be disabled in the options panel)

Due to the nature of FarmIt's purpose (at this time), all mod settings are saved on a per-character basis.
